# A Practical Exploration of Transactional Map Implementations in Java
- Date Written: Monday, March 16, 2026.

This writeup documents the transactional maps I’ve implemented over the last few weeks. It mainly focuses on design, transaction lifecycle, and implementation details. No benchmarks or perf numbers included here

## 1. Optimistic Transactional Map
This is mainly inspired by the approach described in [the transactional collections classes paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/papers/ppopp07.pdf).


### Isolation Level
- **READ COMMITTED** globally
- **SERIALIZABLE per-key** when writes are involved
- No dirty reads, no phantom reads per key

### Implementation
**Core Data Structures:**
- `ConcurrentMap<K, V>` -> The underlying map
- `KeyToLockers<K>` -> Maps each key to operation-specific `GuardedTxSet`s
- Each `GuardedTxSet` contains:
    - A `ReentrantReadWriteLock` (split into read/write locks)
    - A set of transactions waiting on that operation

### Transaction Lifecycle

#### 1. Schedule Phase (when operations are called)

```java
tx.get(key)       // Acquires READ lock immediately
tx.put(key, val)  // Does NOT acquire any lock yet
```

**For reads (GET/CONTAINS/SIZE):**
- Immediately acquire the **read lock** for that operation type on that key
- Add transaction to the `GuardedTxSet` for that key + operation
- Multiple readers can proceed concurrently

**For writes (PUT/REMOVE):**
- No locks acquired yet (lazy intent declaration)
- Just record the operation

#### 2. Validation Phase

**For reads:**
- Already validated (holding read lock since schedule time)

**For writes:**
- Sort all write keys by `identityHashCode()` (prevents deadlock via normal ordering)
- For each key being written:
    1. Acquire the **write lock** for that key
    2. For each conflicting read operation type (GET, CONTAINS):
        - Check if this transaction holds the **read lock** for that operation
        - If yes, **release the read lock first** (prevent upgrade deadlock)
        - Acquire the **write lock** for that operation type
    3. Check if SIZE lock is needed:
        - `PUT` on new key -> acquire SIZE write lock (size will increase)
        - `PUT` on existing key -> release CONTAINS write lock if held (size unchanged, CONTAINS always true)
        - `REMOVE` on existing key -> acquire SIZE write lock (size will decrease)
        - `REMOVE` on non-existent key -> release CONTAINS write lock if held (size unchanged, CONTAINS always false)

#### 3. Commit Phase
- Apply all operations to the underlying map
- Release all held locks (both read and write)
- Remove transactions from all `GuardedTxSet`

### Unique Properties
- **Readers block writers, writers block readers, but readers never block readers**
- The lock upgrade implementation (release read -> acquire write) prevents self-deadlock
- Semantic awareness: doesn't acquire **SIZE** lock when not semantically necessary. Acquire **CONTAINS** lock, only holds on to it if in the case of **REMOVE**(the value exists), and, in the case of **PUT** (the values does not exist)

---

## 2. Pessimistic Transactional Map
This is mainly inspired by the approach described in [the transactional collections classes paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mcarbin/papers/ppopp07.pdf).


### Isolation Level
- **READ COMMITTED** globally
- **SERIALIZABLE per key** when writes are involved

### Implementation

**Core Data Structures:**
- `ConcurrentMap<K, V>` -> The underlying map
- `KeyToLockers<K>` -> Maps each key to operation-specific `GuardedTxSet`s
- Each `GuardedTxSet` contains:
    - A `ReentrantLock` (write lock)
    - An `AtomicInteger` reader count
    - A `Latch` with status (FREE/HELD), parent transaction, and `CountDownLatch`

### Transaction Lifecycle

#### 1. Schedule Phase

```java
tx.get(key)       // Does NOT acquire lock, just registers
tx.put(key, val)  // Does NOT acquire lock, just records
```

**For reads:**
- Add transaction to the appropriate `GuardedTxSet`
- No locks acquired (lazy intent declaration)

**For writes:**
- Just record the operation
- No locks acquired

#### 2. Validation Phase

**For writes:**
- Sort all write keys by `identityHashCode()` for deadlock prevention
- For each write key:
    1. Acquire write locks for GET and CONTAINS operation types on that key
    2. Check if key exists in underlying map
    3. Determine if SIZE lock needed (same logic as optimistic):
        - `PUT` on new key -> acquire SIZE lock
        - `REMOVE` on existing key -> acquire SIZE lock
    4. Set latch status to HELD with this transaction as parent
    5. **Drain existing readers**: spin-wait while `readerCount > 0`

**For reads:**
- Check the latch for the operation type on that key
- If latch is HELD by another transaction:
    - **Waits** on the `CountDownLatch` (blocks until writer releases)
    - When awakened, recheck if the latch has been reacquired else increment `readerCount`
- If latch is FREE:
    - Just increment `readerCount`

#### 3. Commit Phase
- Apply all operations
- For writers: set latch to FREE, countdown the latch (wake waiting readers)
- Release all locks
- For readers: decrement `readerCount`
- Remove from `GuardedTxSet`

### Unique Properties
- Readers use atomic counters, not locks
- Writers must **drain readers** before proceeding (spin on `readerCount`)
- The latch mechanism prevents TOCTOU bugs: check status and await in single atomic read
- More OS context switches due to readers parking/unparking on `CountDownLatch`
- Basically reinvented my own sync primitive(probably worse tbf)

## 3. Read Uncommitted Transactional Map

### Isolation Level
- **READ UNCOMMITTED** -> dirty reads allowed (can see uncommitted writes)

### Implementation

**Core Data Structures:**
- `ConcurrentMap<K, V>` -> The underlying map
- `LockHolder<K, V>` -> Per-key `ReentrantLock`s for writes
- Per-transaction **store buffer** (`Map<K, V>`) -> local cache of writes

### Transaction Lifecycle

#### 1. Schedule Phase
- All operations just record intent
- No locks acquired for reads OR writes

#### 2. Validation Phase

**For writes:**
- Sort write keys by `identityHashCode()`
- Acquire per-key locks in sorted order

**For reads:**
- No validation is needed

#### 3. Commit Phase

Before committing any operations:

```java
// Snapshot current map size
tx.size = txMap.map.size();

// Pre-populate store buffer with current values for each operation with a key
storeBuf.put(key, txMap.map.get(key));
```

Then for each operation:

**For writes (PUT/REMOVE):**
- Apply to underlying map immediately
- Update store buffer with new value
- Track size delta:
    - `PUT` on new key: `delta++`
    - `REMOVE` on existing key: `delta--`

**For reads (GET):**
- First check **store buffer**
- If not found, perform **dirty read** from underlying map
- Return result

**For CONTAINS:**
- Check local store buffer only

**For SIZE:**
- Return `snapshotSize + delta`

### Unique Properties
- **No reader blocking at all**
- **Dirty reads** meaning you might see uncommitted data
- Store buffer provides **read-your-own-writes** consistency within a transaction

---

## 4. Copy-on-Write Transactional Map

### Isolation Level
- **READ COMMITTED**
- Repeatable reads aren't guaranteed
- Still skeptical about the isolation level here though, might be wrong, this could also be **SNAPSHOT** since we get a snapshot(time-stop to call it) copy of the whole map at commit

### How It Works

**Core Data Structures:**
- `AtomicReference<ConcurrentMap<K, V>>` -> Ref to current map snapshot

### Transaction Lifecycle

#### 1. Schedule Phase
- Just record operations in local list
- No locks, no map access

#### 2. Validation Phase

**Retry loop:**
A quite simple retry loop
```java
do {
    prev = txMap.map.get();                      // Get current snapshot
    underlyingMap = new HashMap<>(prev);          // COPY entire map
    // Apply all operations to local copy
    txs.forEach(child -> child.tryValidate());
} while (hasWrite && !txMap.map.compareAndSet(prev, new ConcurrentHashMap<>(underlyingMap)));
```

**tryValidate():**
- Apply operation to the local copy of the underlyingMap
- Store result in child transaction

**If CAS fails:**
- Another transaction committed between snapshot and CAS
- Retry: re-copy map, re-apply operations, re-attempt CAS

#### 3. Commit Phase
- CAS succeeded, so operations already applied to new map
- Just complete futures with stored results

### Unique Properties
- **Entire map copied on every write transaction** -> doesn't scale with map size
- Under high contention: lots of CAS retries -> lots of copies -> terrible write heavy performance
- **Best read performance** when map is mostly read (no blocking, no locking)
- Simple implementation but hard on memory and GC under high write contention

## 5. Flat Combined Transactional Maps

### Isolation Level
- **SERIALIZABLE** (all operations fully serialized through combiner)

### Core Idea

Instead of threads fighting for locks, they:
1. Enqueue their operation
2. Spin waiting for a "combiner" thread to execute it
3. If no combiner exists, try to become one
4. Combiner executes operations for **all** waiting threads in one critical section

### Implementation Variants

#### A. FlatCombinedTxMap (using combiners)

Uses one of four combiner types:

---

##### UnboundCombiner
This is based on the approach described in [this paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/publications/Flat%20Combining%20SPAA%2010.pdf).


**Data Structures:**
- Thread-local `Node<E, R>` for each thread
- Shared publication list (accessible via an atomic ref `Node` head)
- Per-node `StatefulAction` with:
    - `Action<E, R> action` -> This is a volatile barrier
    - `R result`
    - `AtomicInteger status` (ACTIVE/INACTIVE)
- Dummy sentinel node marks end of queue

**Implementation:**

_Enqueue:_
```java
if (node.isInactive()) {
    node.setActive();
    prevHead = head.getAndSet(node);  // Atomic swap
    node.setNext(prevHead);
}
```

_Combine:_
```java
while (action != null) {             // Spin until result ready
    if (lock.tryLock()) {
        scanCombineApply();           // Process all nodes
        return result;
    }
    idle();
    enqueueIfInactive(node);          // Re-enqueue if removed
}
```

_scanCombineApply:_
- Traverse from head to DUMMY
- For each node with non-null action:
    - `node.statefulAction.apply(e)`
    - `node.action = null` (signals completion)
    - Set age to current count
- Every `threshold` passes, scan and **dequeue aged nodes**:
    - If `(currentCount - node.age) >= threshold`: unlink, set INACTIVE

**Keeping Track of a Livelock Bug I Fixed:**
Threads could get stuck when the combiner removed their node before they noticed their action was applied. Fixed by forcing combiners to always re-enqueue and apply their own action rather than trusting others.

---

##### NodeCyclingCombiner (Reuses nodes)

**Key Difference:** Reuses nodes instead of cleanup.

**Data Structures:**
- Thread-local `Node<E, R>`
- Each node has `AtomicInteger status` (NOT_COMBINER/IS_COMBINER)
- Shared `AtomicReference<Node>` tail

**Implementation:**

```java
// Reset current node
Node newTail = local.get();
newTail.status.set(NOT_COMBINER);

// Swap, my node becomes tail, get previous tail
curNode = tail.getAndSet(newTail);
local.set(curNode);              // Previous tail becomes my node

curNode.action = action;
curNode.setNext(newTail);

// Wait to become combiner
while (curNode.status.get() == NOT_COMBINER) {
    idle();
}

//Node chain should look something like this given 3 threads(T1, T2, T3 with the inital node T0),  waiting for their result to be applied, assuming natural order
//TO -> T1 -> T2 -> T3 
// T3 node will be marked as the combiner when Thread 1, finishes applying 
        
// Now I'm the combiner, traverse and apply
for (node = curNode; i < threshold && node.next != null; node = node.next) {
    node.apply(e);
    node.action = null;
    node.next = null;
    node.status.lazySet(IS_COMBINER);  // Make next last node in the queue combiner
}
```

**Unique Property:** Nodes cycle between threads, no cleanup needed.

---

##### AtomicArrayCombiner (A bounded combiner)

**Data Structures:**
- `AtomicReferenceArray<Node>` of size `capacity`
- `AtomicLong cellNum` -> monotonically increasing cell assignment
- Per-thread `ThreadLocal<Node>`

**Implementation:**

_Enqueue:_
```java
cell = (cellNum.getAndIncrement() % capacity);
// CAS into array slot
while (!cells.compareAndSet(cell, null, node)) {
    Thread.yield();  // Slot occupied, retry
}
```

_Combine:_
```java
while (!node.statefulAction.isApplied) {
    if (lock.tryLock()) {
        scanCombineApply();  // Scan entire array
        return result;
    }
    idle();
}
```

_scanCombineApply:_
```java
for (i = 0; i < capacity; i++) {
    Node curr = cells.get(i);
    if (curr != null) {
        curr.statefulAction.apply(e);
        cells.setOpaque(i, null);  // Clear and apply every slot to prevent a situation where waiters spin on an unapplied node forever
        //Best when working with a fixed capacity of threads
    }
}
```

**Unique Property:** Bounded capacity, no pointer chasing, but potential false sharing.

---

##### SynchronizedCombiner (Baseline)

```java
lock.lock();
try {
    return action.apply(e);
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

Plain lock which is used as baseline to measure if flat combining actually helps.

---

#### B. SegmentedCombinedTxMap

**Key Difference:** Instead of one combiner for the entire map, **one combiner per key plus one for SIZE**.

**Data Structures:**
- `ConcurrentMap<K, Combiner<Map<K, V>>>` -> Maps each key to its own combiner
- Separate `sizeCombiner` for SIZE operations

**Implementation:**

```java
// Group operations by key
for (key, operations) in keyToFuture:
    combiner = getCombiner(key);  // Get or create combiner for this key
    combiner.combine(_ -> {
        for (operation in operations) {
            result = operation.apply(map);
            operation.complete(result);
        }
    });

// Separately handle SIZE operations
sizeCombiner.combine(_ -> { /* apply size ops */ });
```

**Unique Properties:**
- Better parallelism -> different keys can be combined concurrently
- More overhead -> one combiner per key
- Writes per key still serialized, but across different keys they're parallel
  Surprisingly, from the benchmarks, a single combiner scales better than a segmented combiner, mainly due to the fact that combiners benefit the fact that batching operations and spinning, amortizes the cost of lock contention, unlike a segmented combiner where batching is less common due to each operation of a transaction mainly working on different keys. However this is just a speculation
---

## 6. MVCC(MVOCC) Transactional Map

### Isolation Level
- **Snapshot Isolation** -> each transaction reads from a consistent snapshot taken at begin time
- No dirty reads, no non-repeatable reads
- SIZE reads are dirty (no version chain maintained for size)

### Core Idea
Rather than blocking readers with locks, each key maintains a **version chain**, an ordered list of all historical values written to that key. Each version has a `beginTs` and `endTs` defining the epoch range in which it is visible. Readers find the version that overlaps their snapshot epoch without acquiring any locks. Writers append new versions and conflict only with other concurrent writers on the same key.

This is based on the approach described in [the VLDB paper](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p781-Wu.pdf).

### Core Data Structures

- `ConcurrentMap<K, VersionChain<V>>` -> maps each key to its version chain
- `ConcurrentMap<K, KeyStatus>` -> per-key write lock (CAS-based, not a real lock)
- `EpochTracker` -> global epoch counter, tracks active transaction begin epochs for GC
- `GCThread` -> background thread that prunes unreachable versions
- `AtomicInteger(size)` -> approximate global size counter

### Transaction Lifecycle

#### 1. Begin Phase
```java
tBegin = epochTracker.currentEpoch(); // Snapshot epoch
```
The transaction records the current global epoch as its `tBegin`. This is the epoch from which it reads any version visible at `tBegin` is part of its snapshot. The epoch tracker also registers this `tBegin` so the GC knows the oldest epoch still in use.

**For writes (PUT/REMOVE):**
- Attempt to acquire the `KeyStatus` write lock for that key via a CAS
- If the key is already locked by another transaction, **we abort immediately**
- Check that `tBegin` still overlaps the latest version on the chain (late-arriving transaction check):
```java
if (!(tBegin >= latest.beginTs() && tBegin < latest.endTs())) abort(); 
```
- If both checks pass, we record the write operation

**For reads (GET/CONTAINS):**
- Check if the key's `KeyStatus` is held by another transaction, if so, abort
- Snapshot the overlapping version at `tBegin` immediately:
```java
seen = versionChain(key).findOverlap(tBegin);
```
- Record the read operation and the version seen

#### 3. Validation Phase
At commit time, a `tCommit` epoch is assigned via `epochTracker.newEpoch()`.Sequentially, each read operation then re-checks whether the version it saw at `tBegin` is still the overlapping version at `tCommit`:
```java
Version overlapAtCommit = versionChain(key).findOverlap(tCommit);
if (seen != overlapAtCommit) abort(); // Someone wrote to this key between tBegin and tCommit
//A quick example
//tBegin = 100, tCommit = 105
//key = "A", versions = [(0,101,"old"), (102,INF,"new")] //INF = INFINITY
// tBegin we should see version "old", while at tCommit we should see version "new"
```
This catches read-write conflicts, if any key you read was written by a concurrent transaction between your begin and commit timestamps/epochs, the transaction is aborted.

#### 4. Commit Phase
- For each write operation: append a new version to the version chain with `beginTs = tCommit`
- Set the previous latest version's `endTs = tCommit` (closing its visibility window)
- Release all `KeyStatus` write locks
- Call `epochTracker.leaveEpoch(tBegin)` so GC knows this epoch might no longer be visible
- If the version chain depth crosses the configured threshold, submit a cleanup request to the GC thread

---

### Version Chains

Each key's history is stored in a `VersionChain<V>`. Two independent implementations exist.

#### QueueVersionChain
- Backed by a `ConcurrentLinkedDeque`
- `findOverlap()` does a **descending linear scan**, meaning we start from the tail of the deque, to find newer versions easier and cut traversal time
- Size tracked with an `AtomicLong` to avoid O(N) `size()` calls on the deque
- Better write performance, lower overhead per version

#### NavigableVersionChain
- Backed by a `ConcurrentSkipListMap` keyed by `beginTs`
- `findOverlap()` uses `floorEntry(tBegin)`, O(log N)
- More expensive writes due to skip list insertion
- Pays off as version chains grow longer under sustained write load

Both implementations maintain a `MinVisibleEpoch` cache to short circuit redundant GC scans when no prunable versions exist, a minimal optimization which avoids a full traversal when nothing has changed.

---

### Epoch Tracking

The epoch tracker actually serves two purposes: assigning monotonically increasing commit epochs, and tracking the minimum `tBegin` of all active transactions so the GC knows which versions are not visible to those active transactions

Three implementations exist:

#### DefaultEpochTracker
- `ConcurrentHashMap<Long, AtomicLong>` mapping epoch -> active transaction count
- `currentEpoch()` registers the transaction in the map and increments the counter
- `leaveEpoch()` decrements; removes the entry when count hits zero
- `minVisibleEpoch()` streams over the key set to find the minimum
- Suitable for virtual threads since keys are shared across threads

#### Long2LongEpochTracker
- Synchronized `Long2LongOpenHashMap` (using fast-util's Long2LongHashMap) maps thread ID -> current epoch
- No boxing on values which avoids allocation pressure on the hot path
- `leaveEpoch()` writes a sentinel value (`-1`) rather than removing the entry
- `minVisibleEpoch()` scans values, skipping sentinels
- This is best paired with pooled platform threads

#### LongToArrayEpochTracker *(default)*
- `ConcurrentHashMap<Long, long[]>` mapping thread ID to a single-element `long[]`
- Same thread-local design as `Long2LongEpochTracker` but avoids boxing via the `long[]` trick without fast-utils's hashmap
- This is best paired with pooled platform threads

---

### GC Thread
Version chains can grow unbounded without cleanup. The GC thread handles pruning old versions that is not visible to any active transaction.

**Design:**
- A single platform daemon thread continuously drains a bounded queue(`LinkedBlockingQueue`) of cleanup requests. Oddly if a platform thread is not daemon and you're testing with JCStress, it always hangs
- A `ScheduledExecutorService` (virtual thread) refreshes a cached `minVisibleEpoch` from an `EpochTracker` every 100ms
- Writer transactions submit a cleanup request when `versionChain.size() % threshold == 0`

**Why I cached epoch reads:**
Reading `minVisibleEpoch()` on every write transaction commit was a hotspot. It involves scanning the epoch tracker under contention. Decoupling this into a scheduled read trades  precision for significantly lower write path overhead. Versions may survive slightly longer than necessary though.

**Pruning logic:**
```java
// A version is prunable if:
version.endTs < minVisibleEpoch && version != latest
```
The latest version is always preserved regardless of its timestamps, since new transactions may still need it. The `MinVisibleEpoch` cache per version chain short-circuits the scan entirely if no version has an `endTs` below the current GC epoch.

---

### Unique Properties
- **Readers never acquire locks** -> unlike the optimistic and pessimistic implementations where readers hold read locks or increment atomic counters, MVCC readers are completely non-blocking. A read is just a version chain traversal with no shared mutable state touched
- Write-write conflicts are detected at commit time
- **Abort-on-conflict instead of wait-on-conflict** -> when a write lock is already held, the transaction aborts immediately rather than parking. This keeps latency bounded but means abort rates climb sharply under high write contention, unlike other transactional map implementations(except Copy On Write) which forces writers to wait
- The queue chain favors writes (O(1) append, cheap traversal for short chains) while the navigable chain favors reads (O(log N) lookup) at the cost of more expensive skip list insertions.
- The shared epoch `DefaultEpochTracker` works correctly with any thread model but contends on `computeIfAbsent()` calls, which could kill perf if frequent. The thread keyed trackers (`LongToArray`, `Long2Long`) eliminate that contention entirely since each key is owned by exactly one thread
